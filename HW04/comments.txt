In HW3, my runtime descreased as thread count increased, and my throughput increased, with MPI. In HW4, my runtime increased a tad as thread count increased, and my throughput decreased, with OpenMP. The two did give fairly similar performances when completing similar tasks, but OpenMP seems to decrease the throughput while MPI decreases runtime. This could be completely wrong because of an implementation error, but we would predict runtime to not decrease if we're using more threads than required for this problem because of Amdhal's law.
